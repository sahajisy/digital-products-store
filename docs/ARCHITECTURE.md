```

## Design decisions
- **Sheet is the single source of truth.** The public `products.json` is generated from it and never contains `supplier_download_url`; `scripts/validate.mjs` fails CI if that leaks.
- **Idempotent fulfilment.** Stripe may redeliver events; orders are keyed by Checkout `session_id` and skipped if already logged.
- **Fail loudly.** A paid order that can't be fulfilled alerts the owner instead of silently dropping: unmapped products and skipped events alert from workflow 01, and any node failure (e.g. SMTP down) alerts via workflow 04.
- **The agent is read-only.** It can read the public catalog and talk; it cannot issue refunds, change prices or see orders. Refunds go to a human.
- **No secrets in the repo or site.** All keys live in n8n credentials; `config.js` is public.

## Known limitations / next steps
- Download links are static supplier URLs. For stronger protection, host files in R2/S3 and email expiring presigned links.
- Catalog sync commits even when nothing changed; add a hash check if the commit noise bothers you.
- Refund/chargeback handling (`charge.refunded`) is not automated yet.
- Chat has no rate limiting beyond n8n's own; put Cloudflare in front of the webhook for production traffic.
